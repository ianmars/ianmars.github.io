<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project I built on the pathtracer I completed in project 3-1 to add several features. In project 3-1 we only supported flat lambertian shading. The first part of project 3-2 implemented support for a variety of materials. First mirror materials and then glass materials which only required simple reflection and refraction.</p> <p>Implementing refraction was a difficult debugging experience that revealed shortcomings in the completed project 3-1 code that were not apparent from the tests required in 3-1. Most importantly sphere intersection did not correctly handle intersections with rays that originated inside the sphere which was similar to a problem I had in project 3-1 with detecting intersections with rays that originated inside a bounding box. In addition to this I continued to be haunted by an inability to find small typos like adding two values instead of multiplying them in a dot product or distinguishing variables with similar names which led to hours of frustration.</p> <p>Next we also implemented rendering of microfacet materials. This was a bit more challenging as it required careful implementation of several complex formulas. This was also a very rewarding portion of the project though as the renderings produced with the microfacet materials look amazing and the models really start to look real.</p> <p>Part 3 was exciting as well. It took a lot of careful reading to figure out what exactly was going on but after that the implementation was very straightforward and it was refreshing to have it actually work on the very first try. Part 4 was similarly easy which was fortunate because it took a lot of work at the beginning to fix/finish my implementation of project 3-1.</p>

  <p>In the first image only the results of direct illumination are visible so the scene is lit but the spheres and shadows appear dark. In the second image one bounce of light allows much of the mirrored sphere to be illuminated and begins to provide indirect illumination in the shadows. Additionally a few reflected rays on the surface of the glass sphere appear. After a third bounce some light from the shadow begins to fill in the lower portion of the mirror sphere and light reflected from the glass sphere can be seen reflected again on the mirror sphere. Afourth bounce brightens the shadows underneath the mirror sphere and fills in the reflection of the glass sphere in the mirror sphere with refracted light that has passed through the glass. Bright refracted light also passes through the glass sphere to the floor. A fifth bounce adds a refraction of the light out onto the blue wall in the lower right corner from the glass sphere. Going out to 100 bounces adds little but noise to the image especially at the relatively low sampling rate of 64 samples per pixel.</p>

  <p>In this series of images we see a golden dragon whose surface gets progressivley rougher. In the first two images the surface is fairly smooth, especially in the first one this can be seen in the sharpness of the edges of the dark portion of the dragon where the surface is not oriented to reflect. This is also a problem in the first one because the low light smapling rate leads to a lot of noise in the highlights which look slightly better in the second image which also has slightly softer edges on the dark parts. The third image increases the roughness even more so that almost all of the dark regions reflect at least some light. The roughness also cuts down on noise in the rest of the scene by softening some of the very sharp, bright highlights present on the smoother materials. In the fourth image the dragon is even rougher giving a very soft fuzzy look and cutting back dramatically on the indirect lighting reflected from the walls.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The two images above show renderings with uniform hemispherical sampling and importance sampling respectively. The difference is dramatic. The importance smapled image has clearly converged to a much greater degree than the uniformly smapled image. Increasing the number of light samples for the uniform sampling image would eventually lead to the two images looking the same but the uniformly sampled image would then take a very long time to render. The shiny surface of the material also leads to a lot of noise in the rest of the scene but the importance sampled image has slightly less.</p>

  <p>This image shows a dragon rendered pretty nicely at 256 samples per pixel and 16 samples per light with a germanium material.</p>

    </table>
  </div>
  <p>In the above two images you can see the difference between uniform spherical sampling and importance sampling of an environment light. Its fairly subtle but especially on certain shadows on the bunny's face and back you can see that the shape of the bunny is more distinct as the shadows are more distinct and blend together less.</p>

    <table style="width=100%">

    </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>These two images show the microfacet model rendered in the same conditions as the two bunnies above. The difference is once again pretty subtle but can be sen in more or less the same places.</p>

    </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>In these four images you can see the plane of focus advancing from the back to the front of the dragon. The focal length of 1.3 isn't the best because the plane of focus falls right between the curves of the dragon so there isn't a lot in the image there to be in focus.</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>In these four images you can see the depth of focus decreasing as the aperture size is increased. In the first picture you can see that most of the head back to the brow is in focus as well as the claw holding the ball. In the second picture you can see that the horns have become much blurrier and the tip of the snout and the claw holding the ball have begun to blur. In the third picture the lower jaw has become mostly blurredand in the back you can see that the tail is almost completely obscurred. In the final picture you can see that only the back few teeth are really in focus, most of the dragon has faded into the background, and the backround has become extremely blurry.</p>
