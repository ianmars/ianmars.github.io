<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project I implemented a simple cloth simulator that models cloth as pointmasses connected by springs and uses numerical integration to perform the simulation. Collisiions with primitives including spheres and planes are taken into account as well as self-collision within the cloth.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
<p>We use a very simple model for our cloth which takes in some parameters about the size and properties of the cloth and represents it as a grid of equally spaced point masses connected by springs. We generate structural constraints as springs form a point mass to the point masses directly above and to the left of it; shearing constraints between a point mass and the point masses diagonally above to the right and left; and bending constraints between a point mass and the point masses 2 above and 2 to the left of it. It was important while implementing this to take into account that point masses on the edges of a cloth might not have all of these constraints.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
<p>We used Verlet integration to approximate the behavior of the cloth under the forces acting on it. The first step was to accumulate all the forces acting on each point mass including external forces like gravity and the internal forces due to the spring constraints. Spring forces were calculated using Hooke's law. We use those forces to determine the acceleration and solve the kinematic equation for the next position approximating the velocity as the change in position over the last time step. We also constrain the maximum deformation of a spring to be 1.1x its rest length.</p>

<p>Changing the density has less effect on the simulation than some of the other parameters and mostly effects the final resting shape of the cloth in how low it hangs and how distinct the ridges are. Changing the spring constant can have a similar effect when it is made very low or high to changing the density where a higher spring constant will make the final cloth hang higher. The spring constan also behaves similarly to the damping factor during before the simulation comes to rest with a lower spring constant or damping factor increasing the time it takes for the simulation to come to rest and having a noisier appearance with small disturbances in the cloth growing and bouncing around for a long time.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
<p>Handling collisions with other objects was fairly easy. The most important thing to keep track of was whether a vector was a position or a direction. Mixing these up could lead to some exciting bugs. Collision checking just involved checking at each timestep whether the new position was inside a sphere or had crossed a plane and then bumping it back to the surface if it had by applying a correction to the old position and then updating the new position to that.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling Self-Collisions</h2>
<p>Self-collisions were a bit trickier than collisions with other objects. We want to check whether any point masses are too close together at any given time but this can be very computationally inefficient if we are checking every every point mass against every other point mass at each time step. So the first thing I did was implement a spatial hashing function (similar to the one described in Optimized Spatial Hashing for Collision Detection of Deformable Objects, Teschner et. al.). The basic idea is to break up the space into many boxes and then only do collision checking between points in the same boxes or nearby boxes and not care about points that are farther away. For points in a box at the end of a time step we check for a given point what other points in the box are too close to it and accumulate a correction vector that would push it away from them and average this correction.</p>
<p>Varying the density seems to effect how flat the cloth lays at the end with a higher denstiy leading to a flatter cloth and a lower density leading to a flatter cloth and a smoother and slower collapse. Higher spring constants make the collapse of the cloth seem smoother and to make it flow better. Notice that the curves are larger for the higher spring constants and the higher denstiy decreases the impact of the initial random offsets in the vertical cloth leading to a flatter cloth that it closer to its original orientation compared to a lower density.</p>
