<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>We will extend project 3 and implement bidirectional path tracing & multiple importance sampling. We will assume the camera is a pinhole camera.</p>
<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Normal path tracer converges slowly for caustics and microfacet materials with low alpha, because we are only using paths originated from the camera, which may not model the distribution of radiance from light sources well. Bidirectional path tracer addresses this issue by using paths originated from both the camera and the light sources and connecting any two vertexes across the paths. Unlike normal path tracer, where in one measurement, for each possible length, we only sample at most one path, in bidirectional path tracer, we may sample multiple paths of the same length, then there arises the issue of weighing different paths of the same length before summing them up. To accelerate the convergence of bidirectional path tracer, multiple importance sampling assigns weights to paths according to how likely a path is sampled by the way it is sampled, given the fact that it is sampled (assuming pinhole camera, a path with length k has at most k+1 ways to be sampled). With bidirectional path tracing & multiple importance sampling, we should expect a significant increase in the speed of convergence over normal path tracing, while both methods should ultimately converge to the same image.</p>
<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p>The baseline plan for this project is to implement bidirectional path tracing & multiple importance sampling for a pinhole camera that support any materials and light sources used by any .dae files given in project 3, with the exception of environment light. Our bidirectional path tracing should converge significantly better than normal path tracing with the same amount of samples per pixel or the same amount of time (although for the same amount of samples per pixel, bidirectional path tracing is expected to take more time than normal path tracing). We will show comparisons of both methods to demonstrate the improvement (especially those where normal path tracing performs poorly).</p>
<p>The aspirational plan for this project can be to add support for environment light, to implement photon mapping, and/or to further upgrade bidirectional path tracing into metropolis light transport, which performs better on caustics.</p>
<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<p>Week 1 (4/3 - 4/9): finish implementing the first version of bidirectional path tracing & multiple importance sampling that support single area light, no specular material, and pinhole camera (almost done at the time of writting this).</p>
<p>Week 2 (4/10 - 4/16): finish implementing the complete version of the baseline bidirectional path tracing & multiple importance sampling, improve speed, and debug.</p>
<p>Week 3 (4/17 - 4/23): continue debugging, double check the math, do the paperwork, and prepare the presentation</p>
<p>Week 4 (4/14 - 4/30): finish any leftovers and optionally execute the aspirational plan</p>
<p>Week 5 (5/1 - 5/7): present and submit</p>
