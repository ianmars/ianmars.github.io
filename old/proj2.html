<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>In this project I took a brief look at bezier curves before jumping into meshes. I implemented de Cateljau's algorithm for evaluating bezier curves and surfaces. I also implemented several functions for working with geometric meshes including edge flipping and splitting. Using these I was able to implement upsampling for meshes as well. Finally I implemented Phong shading. Along the way I learned a lot about the halfedge data structure.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>De Casteljau's algorithm recursively evaluates points on a curve or surface by pairwise interpolation between consecutive control points and then between those interpolated points until a single point is returned and that point lies on the curve. Repeating this interpolation for many different weights gives points all along the curve constructing the curve. My implementation evaluates one step of this algorithm at a time. Given n control points, it takes n levels to fully evaluate a single point on the curve. evaluateStep evaluates one level for a given interpolation parameter t and through repeated calls with the same t can evaluate a single point, then doing this many times evaluate the entire curve.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
<p>I used separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision to extend de Cateljau's algorithm from curves to surfaces. I first define a 4x4 grid of control points. then using the 1D form of de Casteljau's algorithm I can evaluate four curves defined by these four sets of four points. I can then use points on these curves to once again use de Casteljau's in 1D to evaluate a point on the surface. moving over all possible values for the two interpolation parameters I can evaluate the surface.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

<p>Using average vertex normals to interpolate surface normal vectors can give a smoother look to a surface. This is the first part of the project where I had to learn how to use the halfedge data structure. Using the halfedge data structure it is very easy to visit all of the neighbors of a vertex. For two sequential neighboring vertices, the cross product of the vectors connecting the neighbors to the given vertex is normal to the surface containing all three and has a norm equal to twice the area of the triangle they define. If we accumulate that vector for every face neighboring the vertex and then normalize it we have an area weighted unit normal vector at that vertex. We can do this at every vertex and then use those values to interpolate across faces generating a smooth surface normal.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

<p>The halfedge data structure makes implementing the edge flip operation easy. A halfedge is just a bunch of pointers to its neighbors and a mesh is then a bunch these halfedges linking each other together (what's connected to what) along with edges, vertices and faces that hold relevant information like position in space. Implementing the flip operation doesn't require adding any new mesh elements so all that really matters is making sure that all the realtions between elements are changed the right way and everything is pointing at the right thing in the end. Following the advice of the spec I drew detailed before and after pictures and used these to update pointers correctly resulting in a more or less correct flip. It took a couple of tries to get rid of all the bugs but it just came down to making sure that all pointers were assigned correctly. Or so I thought, but we'll come back to that when  we talk about upsampling.</p>

      </td>

  </table>
</div>

<br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

<p>Halfedge split was implemented in much the same way as halfedge flip but with the addition of having to create new mesh elements. After that I followed the same strategy of drawing pictures to guide the update of pointers that would result in the flip. This worked pretty well but as above took several tries to perfect because of several problems not the least of which was using different naming schemes in my handrawn mesh and the code but I was evetually able to get the split to work (sort of, but more about that in the upsampling section.)</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

<p>To implement loop subdivision for mesh upsampling I followed the hints in the spec and the code carefully. The major challenges in this were figuring out when to mark edges and vertices as new and old correctly and figuring out what conditions should be used to determine which new edges should be flipped. I was able to figure this out over several hours of trial and error by breaking it down piece by piece to figure out what parts of the code were sending it into infinite loops. After I was sure that the subdivision code was correct I still Had a bug where over several application some vertices would move out of position especially near edges or corners of the shape modelled by the mesh. I was eventually able to track this down to a couple of inccorect pointer assignments in my edge flip and edge split functions. A few of these were oversights that I just didn't assign at the time because I didn't realize they were important and they didn't come up in testing of the flip and split functions. Most of them came from incorrect translations from my drawings to my code because of the different naming schemes I used when I was drawing and coding and some also came from just typing the wrong name with autocomplete because the variable names were very similar (i.e. the four vertices making up two triangles sharing an edge in an edge flip might be called v0, v1, v2, and v3.)</p>

<br>

<p>Without any preprocessing we can see that upsampling rounds off sharp corners but if we make the mesh finer at sharp corners and edges before upsampling we can preserve that sharpness.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>

</div>

<p>After first splitting and flipping edges near one vertex of the icosahedron to make a very fine mesh, the mesh was upsampled several times. The vertices of the smaller mesh elements are more similar to each other than larger elements where the vertices are farther apart and are able to more faithfully capture high frequency changes in the shape of the model like edges and corners.</p>

<br>

<p>Another issue that can occur becomes apparent on the cube mesh. If the mesh isn't symmetric, upsampling skews the cube a bit in addition to rounding off the corners.</p>

  <table style="width=100%">

      <td>
        <img src="images/dae_cube_ns.png" align="middle" width="400px">

</div>

<br>

<p>This occurs because in the nonsymmetric mesh we take into account the position of the vertex on the opposite side of the face from the vertex we are updating  which is much less representative of the position that vertex should be updated to than its nearer neighbors and itself. Since it doesn't have a matching edge on the other faces bordering it the update pulls it in the wrong direction for the shape we are trying to model. Making a symmetric mesh can prevent it from skewing and making the mesh finer at the corners can also prevent it from rounding off so much to preserve more of its cubeness.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>

</div>

<p>The cube above had a symmetric mesh that was much finer near the vertices. You can see that the symmetry of the mesh preserves the symmetry of the cube and that the finer parts of the mesh preserve the shape of the original mesh more than coarser parts which move more.</p>
