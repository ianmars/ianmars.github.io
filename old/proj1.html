<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project I implemented a simple rasterizer. First I implemented rasterization of single color triangles and then added antialiasing using supersampling to improve smoothness. I then implemented transforms which can translate, rotate and scale elements. The next step was to implement barycentric coordiantes. Barycentric coordinates allow for linear interpolation of values inside traingles from values at the vertices. The next step was to implement pixel mappingThis used barycentric coordinates to map into texture space using coordinates specifie at the vertices of triangles. Then either the nearest texel (nearest pixel sampling) or a linear combination of the 4 nearest texels (bilinear sampling.) The next step was to implement level sampling to reduce aliasing of far away textures and blurring of close textures. I implemented both nearest level and bilinear level sampling which in combination with bilinear pixel sampling is trilinear sampling.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>The first step in implementing this rasterizer was to implement rasterizing triangles. I determined bounds by taking the minimum x/y value of any of the vertices or 0 if it was less than 0 and the maximum x/y value or width - 1/ height - 1 if it was greater than that to determine the bounding box. Initially I was finding these values and storing them as ints but this caused problems later on that eventually led me to use doubles for all values and cast to ints for indexing. I tested whether a point was inside a triangle using the method described in lecture, this required some fiddling with the bounds between '<'/'<=' and '>'/'>=' to figure out what worked correctly. </p>

Additionally, jaggies are prominent especially on the sharper triangles.</figcaption>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
</p>In order to clean up the triangles rasterized in part 1 in part 2 I implemented supersampling which allows a pixel's value to be determined as the average of the values of its subpixels. This can be helpful in the case where a triangle partially covers a pixel but does not cover the center of the pixel. Implementing this introduced more problems similar to those encountered in part 1 that required lota of careful checking of bounds. In order to get everything working properly this was also the point in the project where I jumped from floats to doubles for almost all values. Implementing this change required implementing the get_pixel_color method to average the colors of a pixel's subpixels and also adding extra loops to iterate through subpixels to sample their colors. Increasing the sampling frequency by adding these subpixels cuts back on aliasing at high frequency elements in images such as boundaries.</p>

<p>In the screenshots above you can clearly see from the pixel view that supersampling smooths out the edges of the shapest triangles drastically reducing jaggies and resulting in a smoother look overall.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
<p>Transforms were very straightforward to implement and just involved essentially copying the transform matrices from the svg spec into my code.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates identify points in space by their distance to each of the sides of a triangle relative to the distance of the vertices of that triangle to the sides opposite them. Within the triangle these values scale linearly and since we restrict them such that the sum of the three barycentric coordinates must be 1 they can be thought of as weights on the relative importance of contributions from each fo the vertices. In this case we are assigning a color value at each of the vertices and then interpolating the color of points inside the triangle using the barycentric coordinates as weights on the contributions of colors at the vertices. It can be hard to see the triangles in basic/test7.svg but the simple triangle next to it illustrates how the interpolation works pretty well.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is a technique for sampling textures by indexing into them. In this section we only used level 0 full size textures. The idea is that portions of your drawing correspond to portions of a texture and you can map the texture onto your drawing and sample using those coordinates to draw your texture onto a surface. Nearest pixel sampling is exactly what it sounds like, you sample the nearest pixel of the texture and return that color. Bilinear filtering can reduce aliasing by averaging over several pixels using a linear combination of the values of the 4 closest pixels to determine the sample's value.</p>

<p>In these images we can see that bilinear sampling even without supersampling produces better results than Nearest pixel sampling with supersampling. In particular with images like this one that have lots of high frequecy content bilinear filtering can smooth out rough edges and jaggies and produce smoother images than those made with nearest pixel sampling. Bilinear filtering is slightly slower than nearest pixel samplingbut not as much as supersampling.</p>

<br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>When parts of an image are very close or very far away they can introduce artifacts into the image when the texture is sampled. Far away images may be smaller than the sampled texture resulting in aliasing while nearer objects may appear blurred because they are larger than the sampled texture. Level sampling scales the texture into various sizes so that a very large texture may be used for nearer parts of the image so that they do not blur but a scaled down version of the texture can be applied to smaller features that are farther away without having aliasing. Nearest level sampling is slightly faster than linear level sampling but both produce significantly better images than either of the pixel sampling methods. all the different sampling methods are significantly faster than supersampling and generally produce better images than supersampling alone. Level sampling uses slightly more memory to store the extra levels but each level is half the size of the previous level so the larges level still dominates memory usage. In any case Supersampling uses the most memory especially at high sampling rates where you are storing the size of the entire image several times over.</p>
