<h2 align="middle">Bidirectional Path Tracing & Multiple Importance Sampling With Progressive Photon Mapping</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>

<p>In this project, the path tracer (PT) in project 3 is extended into a bidirectoinal path tracer (BDPT) (for pinhole camera only), with progressive photon mapping (PPM) to handle SDS paths (explained below). In addition, glass material is specially handled to reduce noise (also explained below).</p>

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Bidirectional Path Tracing & Multiple Importance Sampling</h3>
The idea of bidirectional path tracing is simple: shoot a path from both the eye and the light, then connect every pair of vertices accross the paths. But the math behind it is much more complicated. On a high level, the final spectrum value of a pixel is the sum of its values on two graphs (divided by number of samples per pixel), the eye graph and the light graph (need two graphs because when the eye vertex is connected to the light path, the connection edge may cross any pixel on the image plane, not necessarily the pixel that fired the eye path). When BDPT finds a complete path (the eye path hitting the light or part of the eye path connecting part of the light path), it calculates its contribution, and add it to one of the two graphs (light graph if the partial eye path contains only the eye vertex, eye graph otherwise). The contribution of a complete path is determined by the spectrum value it estimates (S), the pdf of sampling this complete path (P), and the weight of this complete path (W) (contribution=S/P*W). S and P are similar to those in PT, what is new is the weight of a complete path. Given a complete path, we say it is sampled by the type i technique if its partial light path has i vertices (directly hitting the light is type 0). Given k vertices, k different complete paths can be sampled by BDPT (no directly hitting the eye since it is a point), whose weights are propotional to the squares of their sampling pdfs, and the weights must sum to 1. This technique of weighing complete paths is called balance heuristic, and the idea of weighing complete paths according to how important they are (how high their pdfs are) is called multiple importance sampling.

<h3 align="middle">Specular Handling</h3>
Handling specular materials in BDPT is simple. Given a complete path that involves specular vertices, the spectrum value it estimates and its sampling pdf is calculated as usual. When calculating weight of this complete path, just make sure the impossible complete paths with the same vertices has 0 pdf in the formula, and the formula itself is the same as usual. Given a path, if the light vertex is on a delta light, then type 0 complete path with the same vertices is impossible, and if an inner vertex (neither the eye vertex nor the light vertex) is specular, let it be the ith vertex from light (light vertex is the 1st), then type i complete path and type i-1 complete path with the same vertices are impossible.

<h3 align="middle">Evidence of Correctness</h3>

<p>For a scene with diffuse materials only (no SDS paths so PPM is not used), it is visually convincing that path tracing, light tracing, and bidirectional path tracing all converge to the same image within reasonable amount of samples per pixel (see <a href="#results">Results</a> below). For the same scene, a convergence curve versus number of samples for one pixel is generated for both BDPT and PT (see <a href="#results">Results</a> below). According to the curve, both methods appear to converge to the same spectrum value. Although these are not conclusive proof of correctness, they provide strong evidence.</p>

<P>To generate these convergence plots we accepted the value of the pixel given by regular path tracing with 1048576 as the true value of the pixel and plotted the % difference between this and the values produced by path tracing and bidirectional pathtracing from 1 sample per pixel up to 1024 samples per pixel.</P>

<h3 align="middle">Strengths of BDPT</h3>

<p>To demonstrate the strength of BDPT, please take a look at the microfacet dragon with alpha = 0.005 (see <a href="#results">Results</a> below). This scene was known to be difficult to render with PT, which allows two types of sampling techniques to contribute to the image: either the eye path directly hitting a scene light (type 0 technique) or randomly choosing a point on a scene light and connecting the eye path to it (type 1 technique). We didn't have to worry about weighting the contributions of different types of techniques in PT because when the last vertex of eye path lands on a specular material, we only count contribution of type 0 technique, and if otherwise, only contribution of type 1 technique is counted. When the last vertex of eye path lands on a microfacet material, since it is not specular, we will only count type 1 technique. However, due to the near specular nature of low alpha microfacet materials, sampling the light vertex by the importance sampling of the scene light rather than the importance sampling of the material makes the rate of convergence extremely low. This is why it was difficult to render with PT. Note that this scene is hard to render with light tracing alone as well, since light tracing only allows type k-1 technique (where k is the number of vertices on a path) and when the last vertex of light path lands on the dragon, the same problem as in PT will make the rate of convergence extremely low. With BDPT however, since there are no specular materials in the scene, a path with k vertices can be sampled by k different techniques (excluding directly hitting the eye), and the contributions of a sampled complete path is weighted according to how important it is, so that techniques that perform better on a given path will be more important to the final image. Thanks to multiple importance sampling, BDPT combines strengths of path tracing, light tracing and other possible techniques and is thus much more robust than path tracing or light tracing alone.</p>

<p>Besides rendering low alpha microfacet materials, another strength of BDPT that outperforms PT is on the rendering of caustics, due to the contributions of light tracing. However, when caustics are reflected and viewed on a specular surface, they will look noisy with naive BDPT.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Weaknesses of BDPT</h3>

<p>Although bidirectional path tracing is much better than path tracing or light tracing alone, it has a notable weakness. Let a scene only contain diffuse or specular materials, when a path consists of only one diffuse vertex whose two neighboring vertices are inner vertices, only type 0 technique (directly hitting the light) will contribute. Since type 0 technique converges slowly (because paths that don't hit the light are simply abandoned), in a scene with many specular objects, paths like the one said above (known as SDS paths) will introduce noticeable noise to the image. One way to denoise is to give up SDS paths; however, reflected caustics will be missing from the final image without SDS paths. With naive BDPT, one has to make the choice between noise reduction and reflected caustics. Neither produce satisfying images.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Progressive Photon Mapping</h3>

<p>Instead of connecting vertices, photon mapping merges vertices and is good at handling SDS paths for this reason. Progressive photon mapping has two stages: the first stage is a ray tracing (from eye) pass, and the second stage is multiple photon tracing (from light) passes. Unlike traditional photon mapping that stores photons in memory, progressive photon mapping stores rays, so that the size of system memory will not limit the number of photons.</p>

<p>In the ray tracing pass, rays are traced like in path tracing. In order to avoid using weights, ray tracing stops at the first non-specular vertex encountered (so that any given path can only be sampled in one way), and the rays are stored for the photon tracing pass. To speed up the photon tracing pass, rays are stored in a kd-tree.</p>

<p>In the photon tracing pass, photons are traced like in light tracing. Different from the ray tracing pass, photons do not have to stop at the first encounter with non-specular materials. At each non-specular hit, the photon will search for nearby rays to merge. If the distance between the photon and the last vertex of a ray is within the radius (R) stored in the ray, the photon and the ray will merge (the kd-tree will significantly speed up this searching process). When this happens, the contribution of the photon will be added to the spectrum value of the ray. The contribution is determined by the spectrum value estimated by the merged path (S), the pdf of sampling this path (P), and the area of the disk within the radius (A=PI*R*R) (area of disk rather than volumn of sphere because local flatness is assumed) (contribution=S/P/A). The final spectrum value of a pixel is the sum of spectrum values of rays originated from that pixel, divided by the number of samples per pixel, divided by the total number of photons.</p>

<p>The progressive features of PPM include that the radius of rays will shrink at each photon tracing pass, and the spectrum values of rays will also shrink accordingly. The result is that as the algorithm continues on, the radius of rays will converge to zero, so that the local flatness assumption will be increasingly true.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Combining BDPT With PPM</h3>
<p>To combine bidirectional path tracing and photon mapping while avoiding using multiple importance sampling across the two algorithms, photon mapping will be used on a path if and only if the first inner vertices on both eye path and light path are specular and there exists at least one non-specular inner vertex on the path. Bidirectional path tracing will be used on a path if and only if it does not satisfy the above conditions. Combining bidirectional path tracing and photon mapping in this way will make the algorithm much more robost for scenes with diffuse or specular materials only (if low alpha microfacet and specular are in the same scene, this is still not enough).</p>

<h3 align="middle">Glass Handling</h3>
<p>With PPM handling SDS paths, the last source of noticeable noise that needs to be handled is the glass. Glass materials are noisy because we used Russian roulette to decide on reflection or transmission, and let the winning path carry all the energy. To denoise, simply trace both reflected and transmitted paths each carrying energy propotional to winning chance. For performance considerations, only specular paths (every inner vertex is specular) applied this technique. In addition, in progressive photon mapping, the ray tracing pass also applied this technique. See the final results below.</p>

<p>The addition of progressive photon mapping allows for scenes containing reflected caustics and SDS paths to be rendered with little noise. Above, specular spheres rendered with 1024 spp and 10^8 photons compared to just path tracing and just light tracing as well as naive bidirectional path tracing for the same scene. Below is a more challenging version of the scene also rendered with regular path tracing, light tracing and naive bidirectional path tracing as well as bidirectional path tracing with progressive photon mapping at 1024 samples perpixel and 10^8 photons. The addition of PPM is less noticeable in the image of the specular spheres but you can see some noise reduction near the base of the glass sphere. In the more challenging image the addition of PPM drastically reduces noise in the reflected caustics on both spheres.</p>
